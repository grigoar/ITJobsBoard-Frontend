## **Top 10 tips for improving your typing speed:**

1. **The average speed for typing is between 30 and 40 WPM**. If you increase your typing to 80 WPM then you will save 50% of your typing time. Even if you might need to invest some time in practice in the beginning, this skill will save you a lot of time in the long run.

2. **Put a goal of what speed you want to achieve and start working toward it**. The higher the speed you want to reach the more time is needed and you will reach an inflection point where you need to take into consideration the time spent on practice with actual gains. The gains will be lower and lower over time and it might not be worth keep practicing it further.

3. **Limit movements**. Try to limit your finger movements and use the designated finger for each key and always bring back your fingers to the default position after typing a key.

4. **First thing is to focus on the accuracy** and when your accuracy is very good then you can try increasing the speed. It takes more time to correct errors than writing correctly at a lower speed, but with almost perfect accuracy.

5. **Balancing the accuracy with speed** while practicing touch typing is a good way to progress faster. This means that you alternate the practice focus. First, you start with the focus on accuracy and when you have great accuracy then you can switch and focus on the speed. You need to trust your fingers to “guess” the next key until the accuracy is not good enough and the cycle repeats.

6. **You might reach a speed ceiling after a good period of time**. In this situation try to focus and be present in the typing process to spot any weaknesses and try to improve them.

7. **Many factors can help you type faster or slow you down**. Here we can include your old habits, your hand and finger's physical shapes, your keyboard, the keyboard layout, your body posture, your lack of focus, and many more. Try to identify each of them and correct them and if you can't try to do the best you can in that situation.

8. **If you are stuck at a speed level, then you might consider drilling**. Drilling is the process of practicing the words typed slower because you make mistakes or your fingers are not accustomed to moving to the next keys in anticipation. By practicing some common words that you are using you will see that you can skyrocket the speed of typing some words and it will increase your overall speed.

9. **If the main scope is to type faster, you can use a different [keyboard layout](/posts/keyboards-and-layouts)** like Dvorak or Colemak instead of using the QWERTY layout. This might improve your typing speed slightly, but learning to type this way may take too much time and in the end, it might not be worth your time.

10. **A good keyboard can boost your speed**. This doesn’t mean that you can’t learn touch typing on a regular keyboard or a laptop keyboard, but you will have some limitations. The mechanical keyboards make it easier to type and there are a lot of characteristics that can help you reach a better performance. Using a mechanical keyboard can be more pleasant and that will give you a reason to keep practicing and improve further.
