## Learning touch typing is a very useful skill in this digital era. Let`s see the top ten benefits of learning touch typing:

1. **Saves time**. Perhaps the most obvious benefit is that you can save time if you type faster. Let's say that you type with a 40 WPM speed and after improving your speed to 80 WPM then you will decrease your time spent typing by 50%. If you save on average 30 minutes per day, then you will save 182 hours in one year. That is like one month of work saved in just one year. But this skill will continue to produce value for the rest of your life, as long as you continue to type.

2. **Increasing your typing speed will allow you to finish faster any work that involves typing**. This way you will be more productive in the long run and this makes you a better candidate in the eyes of employers. The jobs where you are benefiting tremendously from touch typing are Programmer, Journalist, Data Entry Clerk, Virtual Assistant, Legal secretary, and many more.

3. **Touch typing reduces the cognitive friction** of what you think and how to put the thoughts on paper. When you don't have to think about how to write your thoughts you will be able to increase your productivity and keep the focus on what is the problem. This way you will not be interrupted from your thought process.

4. **It can improve your confidence with writing and spelling**. If you are not a native English speaker, practicing typing is a good way to improve your spelling. Computers are not impatient and when you made a mistake you can correct it.

5. **Better posture at your desk**. Touch typing can prevent you from bending over your keyboard as you search for the right keys and it can prevent your neck and back from strain.

6. **You can type in a low-light environment or even in the dark**. You will no longer have to create the conditions to be able to type and this can be a great advantage in some situations.

7. **Learning any new skill that gives you a good feedback loop has a great benefit for your mindset**. Acquiring this skill might take some time, but when you will see progress, you will feel great because of it. This can push you to try new things and to develop or improve other skills as well.

8. Typing is exhausting for the body and brain if you type for a longer period of time. **Touch typing reduces this mental and physical fatigue** because after a lot of practice you will train your memory muscle and you will no longer have to think where the keys are and your fingers will move to type what you think.

9. **Editing**. If you spend time looking at the keyboard instead of looking at the text directly you will not notice the mistakes you made along the way and you will have to review what you typed. Having the option to correct the errors and to correct them instantly will save you time and you will keep the focus on what you want to say.

10. Knowing how to touch type can give you an advantage in your career and besides all other advantages **it can look cool and impress or inspire others**.
