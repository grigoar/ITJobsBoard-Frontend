## Keyboard Layouts

- **There are many different layouts but the most popular is "QWERTY" **. The "QUERTY" layout is the most common one, but it is a US keyboard layout and there are more keyboards adapted to a specific country or region. There are layouts like “AZERTY”, “QWERTZ” and some of the keyboards have other special characters or even emojis.

- **Dvorak keyboard layout was invented for the English language** to offer a better ergonomic and it rearranged the keys to maximize comfort and typing speed. Here, the Dvorak keyboard is not the name of the first-row keys, but it is the name of its inventor, August Dvorak.

- **One-hand typing is also an option** of touch typing that allows having a free hand or the other hand has problems. It can be useful in specific situations, but a potential drawback of this method is that it can be straining on the typist`s hand and it takes more time to learn touch typing only using one hand.

- **Another Keyboard layout is the blank keyboard**. A trained touch typist should not mind using a blank keyboard. This kind of keyboard may force the hunt-and-peck users to type without looking.

## Keyboard Types

- **The quality of the keyboard matters** and investing in one is a good idea if you are typing every day. It is not necessary to buy the most expensive keyboard, but having a good quality keyboard can help you type faster and it can be more enjoyable.

- **There are a lot of keyboard types produced today**. You can have a laptop keyboard, PC keyboard, split keyboard, keyboard with extra special keys, like emojis, blank keyboard, or you can have keyboards with custom layouts.

- **One specific type that is very popular is the mechanical keyboard**. These keyboards are built to last longer, to be more precise, to be more responsive to keystrokes, and to be more comfortable typing for long periods of time.

- **There are different switches and variations for mechanical keyboards but the main ones are blue, brown and red**. The blue switch is more clicky with a tactile bump and audible clicks, the brown switch is more tactile with no click and the red switch is more linear without a bump and no click.

- **In the end the keyboard type matter after you master touch typing** and want to have more comfort or gain some advantages that some keyboards might offer. For example, you can learn touch typing on a laptop keyboard (some are very good) and think about investing in a better keyboard later. Start practicing right now with [Typing Muscle](/).
