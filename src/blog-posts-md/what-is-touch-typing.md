## Here you can learn more about touch typing history, what is touch typing and what is the utility of touch typing:

- The simple answer, touch typing is a technique that helps you type faster and more efficiently by using all your fingers. Typing with this technique is important because it can greatly improve your productivity, especially if you are a writer or a programmer.

- Touch typing is said to be invented in 1888 by Frank Edward McGurrin, who was a stenographer. He taught typing classes to students but he also participated in and won different speed typing competitions.

- Touch Typing, also called blind typing, is a style of typing on the keyboard without using the sense of sight to find the correct keys. As learning and practice touch typing you will know the location of each key on the keyboard through muscle memory. This way, the fingers get so used to typing, that they instinctively go to the appropriate keys without thinking or seeing where the key is on the keyboard.

- In a way, touch typing is like an extension of thinking and by learning to type fast and without thinking about how to type, you can put your thoughts on paper fast and without distraction. This helps with focusing on what we want to say, and this improves our creative thinking process. This way, you don’t create friction between your thoughts and your capability of writing them down.

- Almost everyone knows how to type on the keyboard, but some people learned them by playing games, or typing from time to time. This way of typing was learned as a hunt-and-peck technique (using 2-5 fingers) which could be pretty efficient and have a good speed, but it can’t be scaled to greater speed and comfort.

- For better productivity and to be able to scale your typing speed and comfort, you need to learn touch typing. By letting go of the "hunt and peck" technique, you will be able to type faster, have better productivity and you can focus on your thoughts instead of looking at the keyboard. This can help you do a better job and it doesn’t take that long to achieve 60 WPM (words per minute) as a minimum.

- The correct form for touch typing is to have 8 fingers on the home row (middle row) of the keyboard and use a thumb for the space. Each finger needs to move up and down to the designated keys. Did you ever wonder why the “F” and “J” keys have a little bumper? The little bumps on the “F” and “J” keys are there to guide your index fingers in the right position without looking at the keyboard.

- You can choose from multiple [keyboard types and keyboard layouts](/posts/keyboards-and-layouts) which is the best to improve your typing performance and comfort. Related to the keyboard layouts there are multiple variations, but in the end, the most popular one is QWERTY, even though there might be some more efficient keyboard layouts.

- It might take a little time to [learn touch typing](/posts/start-touch-typing) if you learned typing by hunt and peck technique, but in the end, it is worth it.
