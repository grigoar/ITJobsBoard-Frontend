## Follow the next ten suggestions to improve your touch typing faster and have better results:

1. Practicing makes things better in all fields. You need to practice what you learned so you will be better and more efficient. This is not negotiable. Everyone has their rhythm and pace of learning and progressing, but some common grounds can’t be ignored.

2. After you learn touch typing, you should set your personal goal in terms of speed, but keep in mind you also need very good accuracy. Don’t worry, you can still modify the goal as you practice more and more. This way you will be clearer about what you want to achieve and our minds work better when we know the aim of our actions.

3. To make progress and increase your speed and accuracy, you need to measure your results. This way you know your overall progress and where you have weaker spots so you can start working on that. If you know that some fingers are a little slower or have less accuracy, focus on that and practice until you improve it and try to reach the same level as the others.

4. You should practice touch typing for short periods of time. One popular way is to keep the practice between 15-30 minutes every day for multiple months. In the beginning, it might be required to practice a little longer, like 1 or 2 hours per day, with regular breaks, until you mastered the basics. This way you can keep it fun and you will not feel tired mentally.

5. You should treat learning and improving touch typing as a marathon. It might take tens or a few hundred hours, but the best results are when you spread out the time practicing it. You might need to practice it every day until you reach your desired speed and accuracy, but you need to keep it fun and once you achieve your goals you can move to the next thing and practice just from time to time.

6. You need to be focused on the task at hand. Try to not be distracted and don’t multitask while you learn how to touch type. This will further accelerate your speed of learning.

7. While you keep practicing you will notice that you no longer need to think where your fingers should move and this is a great thing. It means that your brain incorporated your typing into your subconscious mind. This way you can just focus on the thought process. This is almost the same as riding a bicycle. Once you’ve learned it, you will not forget it.

8. When you start practicing touch typing I would suggest trying some specialized sites, like [Typing Muscle](/), where you can focus on typing and only that. It is easier in the beginning if focusing on the progress you’ve made and have measurements and statistics. This helps you to improve faster. In the beginning, your typing speed might be slower than before, especially if you are using more special characters (e.g., programming), but if you keep practicing touch typing your speed and accuracy will increase very fast.

9. What about special characters? Even if you usually don’t use some characters, you still need to develop muscle memory for them to be more confident and to be able to type at a higher speed.

10. Drilling is a technique to improve small mistakes that you keep doing. Identify some words or the weaker parts that you keep struggling with and focus on fixing that so you can improve your accuracy and speed. [Typing Muscle Practice](/practice) offers a dedicated page where you can practice exactly what you want.

"Perfect is the enemy of good". The old saying is that practice makes perfect, but perfect is not always the right goal.
