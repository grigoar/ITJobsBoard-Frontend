## Learn Touch Typing or improve your typing in just ten steps:

1. **Move your fingers to the right position on the keyboard**. The little bumps on the “F” and “J” keys are there to guide your index fingers in the right position without looking at the keyboard. This way you can have all the fingers in the right position on the home row (“FDSA” and “JKL:”). This way you can reset your hand's position at any time.

2. **Memorize all the keys on the keyboard**. This helps in the beginning because you might not know where the keys are and you will have to look to find the keys. One other thing to help you memorize them faster is to use backspace when you pressed the wrong key and then find the correct one without looking.

3. **Don't look at the keyboard**. It can be a little frustrating and hard in the beginning, but you need to resist the urge to look at your keyboard and revert to old habits. Even if you fail, just notice and correct yourself. If it helps, cover your hands with some fabric. You will be surprised how quickly your brain will adapt and learn where the keys are.

4. **Learn the keys for each finger**. Each finger needs to move up and down to the designated keys, as can be seen in the image below. Use the opposite shift when you have to use uppercase letters and use the thumb for space. In the beginning, you might feel that your fingers might not be that flexible, especially the pinky fingers, but this will improve in no time.

5. **Focus on typing accuracy**. Accuracy is the most important because, in the beginning, you need to train your fingers to reach the correct keys. If you don’t care about accuracy, you will make a lot of mistakes and this will slow you down because you will have to correct yourself constantly. When your fingers start moving more automatically on the right keys, then you can increase your speed. You just need to pay attention if you make too many mistakes, and if you do, then slow down a little bit and focus on accuracy.

6. **Sit straight. Posture is very important**. After a long session of typing, if you are not keeping a good posture of your back and also of your hands, then you will have pains. Ensure that you sit straight and your wrists aren’t flat against the table. Dangle your fingers without touching the keyboard keys after you position them. Ideally, keep your wrists hovering about a few centimeters above the table.

7. **Look straight**. Keep your screen at a comfortable angle and keep a good distance from your eyes so you will not have a stiff neck or eye problems after more typing sessions.

8. **It is better to focus exclusively on practicing typing for 15-30 minutes daily**. In the beginning, you need to be fully present at the moment and be careful of what you have to do if you want to learn very fast. If not, then it will take a lot longer and maybe you will learn bad habits in the process. First, you need to master the basics of touch typing and then focus on small things which can help you improve further. This includes practicing some tricky words, different special characters, or other little things that can help you improve your speed and accuracy.

9. **Take breaks**. Remember that this is a new skill to learn, which is a marathon, not a sprint. Don’t type for hours and hours. Ensure you take regular breaks from the screen. This is not something particular to typing, but, in general, it is better for your eyes to not look for long periods at screens. This will also help you to be more refreshed and it will help you to concentrate better when you practice typing.

10. **Practice, Practice, Practice**. The more you practice, the better you become. Learning to type is more like learning to ride a bike or using musical instruments than learning a new language. The main scope is to internalize your typing and develop your typing muscle memory. This only can be achieved after you have a lot of practice and you don’t think about what keys you have to type anymore and your fingers move “magically” on the right keys. But be careful, because if you learn the wrong way, then you will have to go back and focus on what you do wrong and repair it.
